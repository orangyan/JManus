  Find files matching a glob pattern. This tool searches for files matching the specified glob pattern,
  with results sorted by modification time (most recently modified first).
  
  Fast pattern-based file discovery using glob patterns.
  Supports standard glob wildcards (*, **, ?, etc.).
  Recursive search by default (patterns auto-prefixed with **/).
  Patterns NOT starting with "**/" are automatically prepended with "**/" to enable recursive searching.
