  Split text files (markdown, code, HTML, etc.) into smaller pieces. This tool helps break down
  large text files into manageable chunks while preserving content completeness.
  
  Important: Files are read from rootPlanId/ directory, same as GlobalFileOperator and
  MarkdownConverterTool. For example, to split rootPlanId/projects.md, use file_path "projects.md".
  
  The file is split into smaller pieces (as evenly as possible by lines). By default, files are split into 10 pieces.
  In principle, you should keep each split file within 20000 characters.
  Output files are saved in the same directory as the source file, named with index prefix: 0-filename.ext, 1-filename.ext, etc.
