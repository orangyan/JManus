  Count the total lines and characters in a given file. This tool provides detailed statistics
  about text-based files including line count, character count (with and without newlines),
  word count, and file size.
  
  Important: Files are read from rootPlanId/ directory, same as GlobalFileOperator and
  MarkdownConverterTool. For example, to count rootPlanId/projects.md, use file_path "projects.md".
  
  Supported file types: All text-based formats including markdown, code files, HTML, JSON, YAML, etc.
  
  The tool provides the following statistics:
  - Total Lines: Number of lines in the file
  - Total Characters (including newlines): File size in bytes/characters
  - Total Characters (excluding newlines): Sum of all line lengths
  - Total Words: Number of words (split by whitespace)
