description: |
  Create new files or overwrite existing files completely (Write tool implementation).
  This operator provides access to files that can be accessed across all sub-plans within the same execution context.

  Keywords: global files, root directory, root folder, root plan directory,
  global file write operations, root file access, cross-plan files, write file, create file.

  Operation:
  - Create new files or overwrite existing files completely
    - file_path (required): Relative file path (filename or relative path, e.g., 'file.txt' or 'subdir/file.txt'). Parent directories will be created automatically if they don't exist.
    - contents (required): The complete content to write to the file. This will be the entire file content after the operation. If file exists, all previous content will be overwritten.
    - Creates new files if they don't exist
    - Completely overwrites existing files (all previous content is lost)
    - Automatically creates parent directories if they don't exist
    - MUST read file first before overwriting to prevent accidental data loss
    - Prefer StrReplace for editing existing files when possible
    - Only use Write for creating new files or complete file rewrites

  Features:
  - Files created here are accessible by all sub-plans within the execution context
  - Automatically creates parent directories if they don't exist
