  Perform exact string replacement in existing files (StrReplace tool implementation).
  This operator provides access to files that can be accessed across all sub-plans within the same execution context.

  Keywords: global files, root directory, root folder, root plan directory,
  global file write operations, root file access, cross-plan files, replace text, StrReplace.

  Operation:
  - Perform precise, targeted edits without rewriting entire files
    - file_path (required): Relative file path (filename or relative path, e.g., 'file.txt' or 'subdir/file.txt'). File will be auto-created if it doesn't exist.
    - old_string (required): The exact text to find and replace. Must match file content exactly (including all whitespace, indentation, line breaks). Must be unique in the file - if multiple occurrences exist, provide more context to make it unique.
    - new_string (required): The text to replace it with. Must be different from old_string. Can be an empty string to delete content.
    - CRITICAL: old_string must be unique in the file (will fail if multiple occurrences found)
    - Matches are case-sensitive and whitespace-sensitive (must match exactly including indentation)
    - Only replaces the first (and only) occurrence

  Features:
  - Files created here are accessible by all sub-plans within the execution context
  - Exact matching ensures precise replacements
  - Uniqueness validation prevents accidental multiple replacements
  - File will be auto-created if it doesn't exist
