  Read file contents from the local filesystem. This operator provides access to files
  that can be accessed across all sub-plans within the same execution context.

  Keywords: global files, root directory, root folder, root plan directory,
  global file read operations, root file access, cross-plan files.

  Main operation:
  - Read file contents with optional offset and limit parameters
    - path (required): The file path to read
    - offset (optional): Line number to start reading from (1-based). Only use for very large files
    - limit (optional): Number of lines to read. Only use for very large files
    - bypass_limit (optional): If true, bypasses the 300-line limit for full file reads. Use with caution for very large files
    - Output format: LINE_NUMBER|LINE_CONTENT (line numbers are right-aligned, padded to 6 characters)
    - Returns "File is empty." if file exists but is empty
    - Best practice: Read full files unless extremely large (omit offset and limit). For files exceeding 300 lines, use bypass_limit=true or specify offset/limit

  Features:
  - Supports both text files and image files (JPEG/JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP)
  - Files created here are accessible by all sub-plans within the execution context
  - Can read multiple files in parallel for better performance
  
  ## File Reading Best Practices:
  Prioritize small-scope information retrieval:
  1. **Use EnhancedGrep**: For searching specific patterns or keywords in files (most efficient for targeted information)
  2. **Use offset/limit**: Read specific line ranges when you know approximate location
  3. **Use bypass_limit**: Only when you cannot obtain needed information through grep or limited reading, and you need the entire file content
